# DCIT_205_IA
# My Unoffiial Computer Science Department website. 

Introduction:
Welcome to the unofficial University of Ghana Computer Science Department website! This platform is aimed at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for students, faculty, an applicant and anyone interested in the exciting world of computer science.
# Purpose
I designed this simple web page to suggest few changes that can be made to our current website in its next update.


# Cloning and setup instructions:

1.  Navigate to the repository page on GitHub;
      <https://github.com/Jeff-Kalbeni/DCIT_205_IA.git>

2. Click the green Code button on github and copy the URL for the repository.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and change directories to the location where you want to clone the repository

4. Run the git clone command and paste the URL:
 `git clone https://github.com/Jeff-Kalbeni/DCIT_205_IA.git`

5. The project will be cloned to a folder called *YOUR ID_DCIT205*.

6.  Change to the directory where you want the cloned project to be located: 
`cd WHERE YOU WANT IT TO BE`

7. To check if it was cloned successfully, type `git remote -v`.

8. To keep it synced with commits on GitHub, type `git pull` to fetch updates.

# Lessons learned<hr>
THE LESSONS I LEARNT
Generally, I learnt how to design a website from scratch. More specifically, here is a break down of the things I learned in the duration of the interim assessment.

How to fork a repository:
Prior to this project, I have been hearing about git and GitHub but I had no idea of how to create a simple project on GitHub. As part of my appreciation, I would like to use this medium to extend gratitude to the organizers of this project, because it has really helped me to learn a lot in this short period of time. I learnt how to check the status of a project, how to add files stored in a local repository to a remote repository, how to commit changes, and how to configure a git account to be able to make changes.

How to design the frontend of a web page:
I was able to move from ground zero to somewhere above ignorance in web designing. Simply put, I have been able to blend colors, images, texts, and html and CSS commands to put up a simple website.

How to use JavaScript:
I learned how to use JavaScript (onclick) function to link one web page to another. I hope to put in more effort from here to build more systems using the knowledge I gained from this project and the ones yet to come.

Thank you.
